## SchoolSite Pro Data Validation for SchoolSite Pro Redistricting, SchoolSite Pro Projections, and SchoolSite Locator
The SchoolSite Pro Data Validator checks your GIS data for compatibility with SchoolSite extensions.

 

You can access the Data Validator through the SchoolSite Pro toolbar. To open the SchoolSite Pro toolbar, go to Customize > Toolbars > SchoolSite Pro Toolbar.

Depending on your needs, you can choose from three different Data Validators to check your data:

 

1. SchoolSite Pro Redistricting Validation Tool
2. SchoolSite Pro Projections Validation Tool
3. SchoolSite Pro Locator Validation Tool
 

Click on the desired Data Validator and it will open.

 

Please Note: The Data Validator works the same for each kind of validation (Redistricting, Projections, and Locator). Below, only instructions for the Data Validator for the Redistricting extension is shown.

Using the Data Validator for SchoolSite Pro Redistricting Data Validation
1. In order to use the Data Validator for SchoolSite Pro Redistricting, click on the folder icon with the box labeled Study Areas. A browser will pop up.
2. In the browser, select the Study Areas file you want to validate and click Add. The Data Validator will automatically run once you've selected your Study Areas file.
3. Wait a few seconds until the green progress bar under Study Areas fills in. When the check for Study Areas is finished, you will see one of three icons:

If the data is all valid for use in SchoolSite Pro Redistricting, you will see green check marks for each.

However, if you choose data that is missing an optional field, you will see a warning. In the example below, the Schools data resulted in a warning sign. To find out what happened, make sure the Schools tab is selected at the bottom half of the form and read the error log. You will be able to create a plan without fixing the warning. However, if a red, "Not Valid" icon appears, you must fix the error and run it through the Data Validator again before using it to create a new plan.

For more information about data requirements for Redistricting, view the topic, "Data Checks Made for Redistricting Plans".

 

4. After each feature class is validated individually, move onto step 2 to validate their compatibility. To move onto step 2, click the text at the top of the Data Validator that says Step 2: Validate feature class relationships, or click Next at the bottom right corner of the form. You will find that the paths are already filled according to the data you inputted in Step 1.
5. Click on the button labeled Run Validation for each relationship you want to validate. Again, any errors will appear in the bottom half of the form. Otherwise, if your data is valid then a green icon will appear and no errors will be listed below.
6. When your relationships are all green, you are good to go! Use the data you validated to create your new redistricting plan without any data errors.

If you have need further assistance, the log files can be emailed to Davis Demographics' Tech Support directly by clicking the button Email Log at the bottom of the Data Validator. Otherwise, you can export your results and email them yourself to techsupport@davisdemographics.com.
