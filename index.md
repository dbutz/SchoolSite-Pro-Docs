# Welcome to SchoolSite Pro
SchoolSite Pro is the planning tool developed and used in-house by Davis’ staff and also empowers school planners with GIS experience to create student forecasts and attendance area redistricting plans. As an extension for Esri’s ArcGIS Pro, SchoolSite Pro allows users to compare their plans with the wealth of GIS data available to planners and perform powerful analysis.
