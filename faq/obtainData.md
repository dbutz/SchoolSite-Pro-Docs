# Where Can I Obtain Data?
The District can use ArcGIS to create schools, students, and study areas. Street data, which is needed by the district to create school, student, and study area data, can come from a variety of sources.

 

If the District does not have a street database, the best source of data, if possible, is usually your local city or county's GIS Department.

## Free Data Sources
If your city or county does not keep Esri formatted street data, there are several free sources available. However, keep in mind that because this information is free, you usually get what you pay for in terms of accuracy.

 

1. Your local city

1. Your local county

1. Your state

1. U.S. Census Data

1. Esri maps and data - Available at no cost with your ArcGIS license

## Commercial Data Sources
Additionally, street databases can be purchased from many third party vendors such as:

 

* [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/en_us/) can license their street data in Esri format on a county basis. The data can be licensed for display, geocoding and/or routing.

* [HERE](https://www.here.com/) (formerly NAVTEQ) can license their street data in Esri format on a county basis. The data can be licensed for display, geocoding and/or routing.
