## Step 1: Validate individual feature classes
There are two required datasets that are required for SchoolSite Locator:

1. [Study Areas](../createData/createStudyareas.md)
2. [Schools](../createData/createSchools.md)
 

Additionally, there is one optional dataset that you may want to include:

1. [Trustee Areas](../dataManagement/createData/createTrustee.md)
