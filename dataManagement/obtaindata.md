# Where Can I Obtain Data?
Schools, students and study areas can be created by the District using ArcGIS. Street data, which is necessary for the district to create school, student and study area information, can come from a variety of sources.

 

If the District does not have a street database, the best source of data, if possible, is usually your local city or county's GIS Department.

## Free Data Sources
If your city or county does not maintain Esri formatted street data, several free sources are available.  However, be aware that since this data is free, you usually get what you pay for in terms of accuracy.

 

1. Your local city

1. Your local county

1. Your state

1. U.S. Census Data

1. Esri maps and data - Available at no cost with your ArcGIS license

## Commercial Data Sources
Additionally, street databases can be purchased from many third party vendors such as:

 

[TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/en_us/) can license their street data in Esri format on a county basis. The data can be licensed for display, geocoding and/or routing.

HERE (formerly NAVTEQ) can license their street data in Esri format on a county basis. The data can be licensed for display, geocoding and/or routing.

 

However, if the District would rather have Davis Demographics create the data, we would be happy to provide you with a quote. For more information, please contact us at:
