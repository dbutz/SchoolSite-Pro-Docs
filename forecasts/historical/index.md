# Include historical student data in your report

SchoolSite Pro gives you the option to include up to three years of historical data into your forecast report. Adding two or three years of historical data helps to generate a more accurate forecast report for your district. It will help when analyzing trends and patterns in your district's data.

## How to add historical student data to your project
You can add historical student data to your report at any time. On the SchoolSite ribbon, click Data Setup. A dockpane will show up called Data Setup. Under Historical Students, click the yellow folder icon next to 1 year ago to browse for your student data from one year ago. If you already have the data in your map, you can search for that layer's name in the dropdown menu. 

Repeat this step for data from 2 years ago. If you only have two years of data, you can proceed. Otherwise, you can repeat the same steps for data from 3 years ago.

Under Weighted Mobility Options, select one of the three options:
- No weight
- Weight most recent (Current x3)
- Weight least recent (Three years ago x3)

When you are finished, click Import. 

## How to display historical student data on your forecast report
Displaying your imported historical student data on your forecast report is easy. On the Forecasting ribbon, click Forecast Reports. A dockpane will show up called forecast Report. If you have imported your historical student data, click the box next to Display historical student data. Then click Run. You will notice that your report now includes two or three additional columns of historical student data to the leftmost of your original report.
