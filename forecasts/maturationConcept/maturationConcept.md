# Maturation Concept

While seven to ten year projections are helpful for planning in the short term, maturation projections are better suited to long term forecasting and site selection.
It is not good planning practice to base long term site selection and facility needs based upon short to mid-term forecasts.  The decision a planner could make for locating a 
future school using a ten year forecast may not be the best decision as development continues to occur further into the future. 
For example, a future school site placed in or near a development occurring in the next few years may not be the best location for that school in relation to other potential 
school sites, as future development projects expand into other areas of the district.

 

Maturation projections are essentially a housing saturation forecast from which SchoolSite will estimate the total number of students within each study area that the district can
expect when all available parcels have been developed under current zoning conditions (commonly referred to as "build out").

 

There is no specific time frame implied as to when maturation will occur.  It cannot, and should not, be assumed that this is the "eleventh‚Äù year of a ten year projection. 
Maturation projections are calculated completely separate from the ten year projections.  As part of your District's master plan, maturation projections provide a long-term 
outlook of the student population and distribution when all housing is accounted for.  

 

In a typical Master Planning scenario, the planner would generate both a ten year projection and a maturation projection. Using the maturation student projections by study area, 
a redistricting plan (using SchoolSite Redistricting) would be created for each grade grouping within the district (K-6, 7-8, 9-12, etc.) to evaluate the location and facility
needs of future school sites when all land is developed.  In the K-6 elementary plan shown below, three schools currently exist and two additional sites have been determined to 
be necessary at build out. One is on the east side of the district and one is in the northwest area of the district.  This is the Master Plan for elementary schools in this example
District.
