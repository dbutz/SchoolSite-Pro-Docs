# Decide what data to include in your forecast

SchoolSite Pro gives you the option to include tract and/or assessor data into your forecast. 

## When to include tract data
Tract data describes the location and phasing for planned residential development within the district. Click [here](../dataManagement/createData/createTracts.md) for more information about tracts. 

Including tract data into your forecast adds housing development information to your forecast. It will allow you to generate a development summary report for your District, or a project summary report. In combination with student yield factors, it allows your forecast to consider new housing built in the future.

## When to include assessor data
Assessor data is a table of parcel information that was geocoded to a street network.  Click [here](../dataManagement/createData/createAssessor.md) for more information about tracts. 

Including assessor data into your forecast allows formaturation (build out) information to be added to your forecast. It can be used to determine student yield factors by housing type, and is also used in estimating the number of existing dwelling units for maturation projections. In combination with tract data, assessor data allows your forecast to consider new housing built in the future.
