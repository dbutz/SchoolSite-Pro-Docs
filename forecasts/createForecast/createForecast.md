# Create New Forecast

To create a new set of projections: Choose SchoolSite Projection Toolbar > SchoolSite Projection > Create New Projection.

SchoolSite projections, along with the data they are based upon, are stored in a special geodatabase called a SchoolSite Desktop geodatabase.  You can have an unlimited number of projections (and their associated data) stored in a SchoolSite geodatabase.
When you create a new projection you have two options:
1. Store your new projection in a new empty SchoolSite geodatabase
2. Store your projection in a existing SchoolSite geodatabase

## Enter the Study Area and School Data
A second window will appear and prompt you to enter the location of the required data. If you are creating a new projection in an existing geodatabase then the following dropdown menu will already populated with data. Otherwise, add new Study Area data to your geodatabase by clicking on the yellow folder next to the field "Specify study area polygon data" and navigating to the location of the study area polygon data. Click OK. The dropdown menu will be populated for study area polygon data.
