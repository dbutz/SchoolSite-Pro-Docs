# Student Yield Factors

Calculating Student Yield Factors
The Student Yield Factors, when applied to projected housing units, determine how many additional students will be generated from new residential construction within the district.


 

Two sets of data are required to calculate Student Yield Factors: current student data by residence (provided by the District) and current housing unit data
(from the District's local County Tax Assessor files).  Each student record and tax assessor record is geocoded by their given address.  You may then use ArcMap analysis tools to
select a sampling of tax assessor/housing unit records and student records to determine student yields.  The samples should include different housing types and the students being
generated from those housing units.

 

Next, the year of construction must be analyzed for each housing type: Single-Family Detached (SFD), Multi-Family Attached (MFA) and Apartments (APT).  In general, SYFs used in a 
ten year projection are calculated from units built within the last five years to better represent the actual number of students coming from new housing units when they are 
completed. For example, if there are 50 students living in 100 MFA units which were built between 1999-2004, the SYF would equal 0.50.  These calculations are performed to produce
a Student Yield Factor for grade ranges K-6, 7-8, and 9-12.

Example:

Grade Range: K-6

The result is one student yield factor by housing type for each grade range.

Student Yield Factors apply only to years 1 through 10 in the projection properties table.

**Please Note: Student Yield Factors are only necessary for those districts that have development taking place within their boundaries.  If your district is fully developed, or built-out, SYFs are not needed for running 10 year projections.**

 

## Entering Student Yield Factors
1. Click on the drop down menu for Modify factor in the forcasting ribbon and choose Student Yield Factors.
2. You can turn on and off each of the housing types by clicking in the check box next to that type located in the area entitled “Specify types to display”.  (Remember: Types 1 through 4 correspond to the housing type definitions defined in the tract or assessor datasets.  Typically, type 1 refers to single family detached (SFD), type 2 refers to multi-family attached (MFA), type 3 refers to apartments (APT) and type 4 refers to mobile homes (MBL), however, you can assign whatever housing types are appropriate for your District and its proposed development to Type 1 through 4.

3. Next, specify the study areas to display by clicking the radio buttons next to the options: currently selected on the map, select by attendance area, or select all.  

4. Finally, enter the student yield factors by clicking on the top of the column for the desired grade range and enter the value in the calculate box at the bottom of the form.  Alternatively, you can change the student yield factors in individual study areas by clicking in each individual cell -- this allows the planner to apply different student yield factors to different housing types in various areas of the district.
