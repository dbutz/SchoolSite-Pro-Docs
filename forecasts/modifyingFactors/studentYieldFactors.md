# Student Yield Factors

Calculating Student Yield Factors
The Student Yield Factors, when applied to projected housing units, determine how many additional students will be generated from new residential construction within the district.


 

Two sets of data are required to calculate Student Yield Factors: current student data by residence (provided by the District) and current housing unit data
(from the District's local County Tax Assessor files).  Each student record and tax assessor record is geocoded by their given address.  You may then use ArcMap analysis tools to
select a sampling of tax assessor/housing unit records and student records to determine student yields.  The samples should include different housing types and the students being
generated from those housing units.

 

Next, the year of construction must be analyzed for each housing type: Single-Family Detached (SFD), Multi-Family Attached (MFA) and Apartments (APT).  In general, SYFs used in a 
ten year projection are calculated from units built within the last five years to better represent the actual number of students coming from new housing units when they are 
completed. For example, if there are 50 students living in 100 MFA units which were built between 1999-2004, the SYF would equal 0.50.  These calculations are performed to produce
a Student Yield Factor for grade ranges K-6, 7-8, and 9-12.

Example:

Grade Range: K-6

| SYF (SFD) = | Current Students by SFD / # of SFD units |
| SYF (MFA) = | Current Students by MFA / # of MFA units |
| SYF (APT) = | Current Students by APT / # of APT units |
