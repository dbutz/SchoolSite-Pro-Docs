# Distributed Enrollment
Maturation is the total housing units times the maturation student yield factor.
However, there is one more factor which needs to be applied in order to run the maturation forecasts. 
The Distributed Enrollment factor takes the forecasted number of students at maturity and applies a weighted distribution among the grade levels.

 At the elementary level, students are distributed evenly across grades K-6 with a factor of 0.14285.  At the intermediate level they are distributed equally across
grades 7 and 8 with a factor of 0.5.  You will not be able to change those numbers.

The high school level is different.  Dropout rates are much higher in high school.  Patterns have shown that high schools continually lose students as they advance
through the grades.  With the Distributed Enrollment Factor, you can weigh heavier the earlier high school grades, if desired, based upon trends within your district.  However, grades 9-12 must equal 1.00.
By default, grades 9 â€“ 12 are calculated at 0.25 (In other words, students generated for high school are distributed evenly across grades 9 through 12).

## Modifying Distributed Enrollment Factors
By default, the factors above are applied. To modify the high school level Distributed Enrollment Factors:
