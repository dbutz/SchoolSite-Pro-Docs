# Calculating Projected Housing Units
Closely related to Student Yield Factors are projected housing units.  Projected housing development data along with student yield factors (SYFs) are used to estimate (add in) the number of students generated from new housing developments.

 

**Housing information entered in the tract dataset can be automatically entered into the Projection Properties table if specified in the Create Projection Wizard.**
