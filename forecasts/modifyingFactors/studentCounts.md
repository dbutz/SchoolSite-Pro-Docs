# Student Counts
The Student Counts form allows you to review the number of current students by grade level for each study area in the district. The table is automatically filled in from the geocoded student dataset specified in the projection wizard.  However, if you know that there are certain study areas that should have additional students in them, you can click in the appropriate cell and add them manually.  This is a rare occasion, but can happen when, for example, students are entered into the system late and thus were not geocoded.

# Entering Student Counts

1. Click on the drop down menu for Modify Factors in the Forecasting ribbon.

2. Under the section "Specify grades to display", check on or off the desired grades.

3. Under the section "Specify study areas to modify by:", choose between a current selection on the map, existing attendance areas, subdistrict or all study areas.

4. Click individual cells in the Student Counts table to change and type in the number of students by grade per study area.
