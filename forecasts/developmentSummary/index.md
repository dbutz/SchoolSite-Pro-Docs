# Development summary report

If tract data is present in your SchoolSite Pro project, you have the option to generate a development summary report. A development summary report provides general information about the numbers and types of housing development going on in your District. The report is broken down by year, giving you a clear picture of housing that is planned for the next three to ten years. This information can help you understand which schools will be affected in the next few years, and can help you make better decisions when redistricting your students. 

To generate a development summary report, go to the Forecast ribbon. Click Modify Factors then Projected Housing Units. The Projected Housing Units dockpane will display. At the bottom of the form, click the Export Development Summary button to generate your report. A pop-up will display with the location of your report when it is finished generating.
