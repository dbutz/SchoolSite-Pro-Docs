# Project summary report

If tract data is present in your SchoolSite Pro project, you have the option to generate a project summary report. A project summary report provides information about each project going on in your District. The report is broken down by year, giving you a clear picture of projects that are planned for the next three to ten years. This information can help you understand which schools will be affected in the next few years, and can help you make better decisions when redistricting your students. 

To generate a project summary report, go to the Forecast ribbon. Click Modify Factors then Projected Housing Units. The Projected Housing Units dockpane will display. At the bottom of the form, click the Export Projects Summary button to generate your report. A pop-up will display with the location of your report when it is finished generating.
