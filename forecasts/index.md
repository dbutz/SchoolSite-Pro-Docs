# SchoolSite Enrollment Forecasts
Welcome to the SchoolSite Forecast Extension for SchoolSite Pro! The Forecast Ribbon provides a user friendly, intuitive method to predict future student enrollment.

## SchoolSite Forecast Key Functions:
* Locate potential future school sites
* Determine future school capacity requirements
* Analyze future school attendance boundaries
* Create an unlimited set of projection scenarios based on various factors like birth data, historical enrollment, future development, etc.
* Update projection variables through a spreadsheet-like interface
* 3, 5, 7, or 10 year projections by grade level along with optional "build-out"/maturation projections for long range planning
* Projections and reports are created by study areas, existing attendance zones, user-defined sub-districts, or district wide
* Projections summarized by any grade configuration (K-5, K-6, 7-8, 6-8, etc.)
* Dynamically display enrollment projections in ArcGIS through color shading and map labelling
* Enrollment projections are automatically linked to the Redistricting Extension
* Generate reports to aid in future staffing decisions based on historical data
