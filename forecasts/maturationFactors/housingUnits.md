# Current Housing Units

The first step in determining the Current Housing Units needed to run maturation projections is a 
current geocoded assessor file. The assessor file is used to establish a housing count by unit type 
for each individual study area.  

## Entering Assessor Data
When creating a new projection, the 4th screen in the wizard provides the option to include 
assessor data (find out where to locate sample assessor data here):

1. Check the box next to "Use an Assessor's dataset (optional)".

2. Next, select the geocoded assessor dataset to use by clicking on the yellow folder under the 
option "Where is your Assessor data located?".

3. Below the field where you locate your data are two drop-down windows. From the Housing-type field choose the field that contains the housing unit type.  From the Housing-unit field choose the field in the assessor data file that contains the number of units on each parcel.  Usually, assessor data coded as single family residence (SFD) would have a housing unit count of one, whereas a parcel that is used for apartments would have the number of apartment units.  After selecting the housing type field, SchoolSite will automatically look through all the values in that field, and you should match the values it finds with the four types for which maturation student yield fators (MSYF) will be applied. The values and types should match those that are used in your tract dataset.

4. Click Finish to create a new projection.
 

## Modifying Projected Housing Units for a Projection with Assessor Data
1. Open the projection to be modified. Then from the SchoolSite Projection Toolbar, click the projection properties button .

2. Under "Specify variable to modify", click the dropdown menu to Projected Housing Units.

The screen below illustrates current housing units from the assessor data in Year0 for several study areas. You have the option to modify 
these numbers of housing unitsif you have data that indicates otherwise.
