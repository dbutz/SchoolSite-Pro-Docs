# Potential Development

## Calculating Potential Development
As part of the creation of the new projection, if you specified a tract dataset during projection 
creation, Years1 through 10 would be filled in with the data from new development projects.  In some 
cases, where certain residential tracts have completion dates beyond the ten year projection time frame,
those units will be indicated in Year11 (Year11 is a place holder for units to occur after Year10.
It does not indicate those units will be built in 11 years.). Depending upon which study areas have
vacant property, you may wish to add additional units into Year11 that you feel could potentially be
built based upon land use, zoning, etc.

 

1. Determine areas of the district that have the potential for additional housing by inspecting the 
aerial photographs and comparing those areas to land use and zoning maps to determine if they are
slated for residential development.

2. In ArcGIS, add your study area and street layers to the map display.  Zoom in to the areas you have
determined from aerial photography to have potential residential development.

3. From the Data Frame Properties window, choose the General Tab.  Be sure your map units are in the
 appropriate units. (The coordinates/map units for most data provided by DDP is in feet.)

Using the New Polygon tool , draw a polygon of the area of potential development.  Right-click on the polygon and choose properties. In the dialog window that appears click on the area tab and ArcMap will report the area in any map units you choose such as acres.  

By multiplying the number of acres by the number of units allowed per acre, you will arrive at the maximum potential number of residential units for that area.

You will then need to add these numbers into Year 11 for the appropriate study areas in the Projected Housing Units table.
