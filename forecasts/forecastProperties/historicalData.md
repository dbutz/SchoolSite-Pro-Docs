# Historical Residence Data in Forecast Report

The SchoolSite Forecast Extension is a useful tool in predicting future student totals in each of your district's schools. When analyzing your projection reports, it might be helpful to look back at the previous 3 years of student data to make a better, more informed decision. You can include up to 3 years of historical residence data in your projection report.

 

To include historical residence data in your projection report, you must have at least 2 years of historical student data, although 3 is recommended

Click on Modify Factors in the Forecasting Ribbon and choose Mobility Factors.

Browse for your historical student data by following the instructions in Mobility Factors and be sure to check mark the box labeled Include summarization of annual historical enrollment grade counts for reporting.

 

After mobility is calculated, you can choose to import your mobility factors, or just close out of the results window. Your historical residence data will now be available.

 

To display your historical residence data, navigate to Residential Projections > Report > Setup, and select the following options:

 

1. For **What do you want to display?** , select **By District Summaries**

2. For **Which district do you want to display?** , select **District wide**
