# Forecast Properties - Map Display

The display tab on the Student Projection Properties window allows you to graphically view your
projections in different ways in ArcMap. For each of these display options, enter a grade range at the
bottom of the display window.  When you select an option to display your projections, the projection 
layer in the table of contents in ArcMap will change appearance (layer title, color, etc.) to indicate
what is displayed.
