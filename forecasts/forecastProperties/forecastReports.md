# Generate a forecast report
Forecast Reports button on the Forecasting ribbon allows you to set up, generate, view, and export the results of your forecasts.

On the Forecasting ribbon, click Forecast Reports. A dockpane will display.

There are two tabs in the dockpane: Setup, and View.

The setup tab appears first by default. From the setup form, you can indicate what forecasts (geographic areas, grade ranges, etc.) you wish to display in the view tab. 

There are four criteria to set up for your forecast:
* What do you want to display? (study areas, attendance areas or district summaries)
* Which district do you want to display? 
* What grades and grade ranges to display?
* How many years of projections to display?

 You can also choose to display maturation and/or display historical student data.

## What do you want to display?
The first option What do you want to display? has three choices: By Study Area, By Existing Attendance Area, and By District Summaries. Depending on which selection you make, additional choices on the setup form will appear.

1. **"By Study Area”** will display the forecasts for each study area you have chosen to display. You have three options, as shown below. They are: study areas you currently have selected on the map, a single study area which you choose from the drop down menu, or all study areas. The choice Currently Selected on the Map is only available (i.e. not grayed out), if you have selected study areas on your map.

2. **“By Existing Attendance Areas"** will display the forecasts for the chosen attendance area(s) for whatever grade level you choose. Attendance area forecasts are, in essence, a summarization of all the individual study areas forecasts making up the attendance area. After choosing the school type, choose either a single attendance area (which you select from the drop down menu), or all attendance areas (all of that school type). The third option is to display all schools by type (elementary, middle or high) that are contained within a selected subdistrict. A subdistrict refers to the district field within the study area dataset. Many times there are values in the "district" field that indicate additional geographic areas such as board trustee areas, city boundaries etc. If you have coded your study areas with unique subdistrict values, you may select and display attendance area forecasts that fall within the selected subdistrict.

3. **“By District Summary”** will summarize all study areas and display them as a district wide report or you can choose a subdistrict.
