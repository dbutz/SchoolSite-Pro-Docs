# Forecast Properties - Forecast Reports
The Forecast Reports button on the Student Projection Properties window allows you to view, print, and export the results of your projections.

![]()

There are two tabs on the Report view:
* Setup
* View

The setup tab appears first by default. From the setup form, you can indicate what projections (geographic areas, grade ranges, etc.) you wish to display in the view tab. 

There are four criteria to set up for your forecast:

* What do you want to display? (study areas, attendance areas or district summaries)

* Which district do you want to display? 

* What grades and grade ranges to display?

* How many years of projections to display?

 You can also choose to display maturation and/or display historical student data.

## What do you want to display?
The first option What do you want to display? has three choices: By Study Area, By Existing Attendance Area, and By District Summaries. Depending on which selection you make, additional choices on the setup form will appear.


1.**"By Study Area”** will display the projections for each study area you have chosen to display. You have three options, as shown below. They are: study areas you currently have selected on the map, 
a single study area which you choose from the drop down menu, or all study areas. The choice Currently Selected on the Map is only available (i.e. not grayed out), if you have selected study areas from within ArcMap prior to opening the Projection Properties dialog box.

2. **“By Existing Attendance Areas"** will display the projections for the chosen attendance area(s) for whatever grade level you choose.  Attendance area projections are, in essence, a summarization of all the individual study areas projections making up the attendance area.  
After choosing the school type, choose either a single attendance area (which you select from the drop down menu), or all attendance areas (all of that school type).  The third option is to display all schools by type (elementary, middle or high) that are contained within a selected subdistrict.  A subdistrict refers to the district field within the study area dataset.  
Many times there are values in the "district" field that indicate additional geographic areas such as board trustee areas, city boundaries etc.  
If you have coded your study areas with unique subdistrict values, you may select and display attendance area projections that fall within the selected subdistrict.
