### Licensing


SchoolSite Pro uses a single-user licensing model on a subscription basis. In order to use SchoolSite Pro, a license ID and an activation password are required. You can obtain these with your SchoolSite Pro subscription. Talk to one of our [specialists](https://davisdemographics.com/get-started/) about licensing.
