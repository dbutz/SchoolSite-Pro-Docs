# Statistics Window
## The Statistics Window: Current Residence
The Current Residence Tab allows you to preview the statistics before making changes to a plan.  The first tab, current residence, shows the number of students by residence before you assign any selected study areas.  Once you assign the selected study areas however, the current residence window updates to reflect the adjustment.  The school name highlighted in blue is the school to which the last study areas were assigned.
