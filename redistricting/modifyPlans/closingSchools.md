#  Closing Schools

In order to simulate the closing of a school, the assigned study areas must first be reassigned to other schools.  Use the selection tools to assign study areas to neighboring schools (You can view the statistics window to note the changes as you adjust the boundaries).  Once you have reassigned all study areas away from the school you wish to close, save your assignments.
