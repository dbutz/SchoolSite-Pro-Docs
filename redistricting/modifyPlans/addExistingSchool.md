# Adding an Existing School
You may wish to create boundaries for an existing school facility that is not currently in this plan (i.e. You have created an elementary school plan and want to experiment with converting a closed junior high school to an elementary school).

 

If necessary, save assignments and stop assigning study areas.
From the SchoolSite Redistricting Extension Toolbar, choose the assign tab, then Update Schools.

All schools not represented in the current active plan are listed in the drop-down box.  Choose one of the schools, then click OK. SchoolSite will add the school point location to the map and add the name of the school and a new color to the plan in the table of contents.  You may now start assigning study areas to the added school.
