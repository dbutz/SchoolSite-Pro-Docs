# Change boundaries between schools
You might need to make redistricting changes after reassigning study areas or if your district has to make changes to existing boundaries. You can make these changes to balance student population by residence and site capacities.

To reassign study areas to existing schools, you must have at least one plan open in the SchoolSite Pro table of contents and have the plan you wish to edit as the active plan.

### 1. Begin the editing session: Choose the assign tab under Redistricting Plan. Then choose Start in the Assign ribbon.

**Use Caution when Assigning:**
When assigning study areas, please refrain from using any other editing tools and only use the Undo button provided in this ribbon. Otherwise, you could expereince unexpected results when moving study areas between attendance boundaries. Once you click "Stop Assigning" you can then use all the editing tools and the normal undo button without affecting your plan.

### 2. To reassign study areas from existing schools, from the assign ribbon, click on the drop-down arrow under "Assign study areas to:" and select the school to which you wish to assign the study area(s).
