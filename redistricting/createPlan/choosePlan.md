## Types of Redistricting Plans 
There are three types of plans that can be created in SchoolSite Pro:

### Type 1) Create Plan Based on Current Residence
A redistricting plan based upon current resident students displays the number of students actually residing within each attendance area whether or not they are enrolled in the area's assigned school.  As attendance areas are modified, all students residing in the selected areas are moved to the newly assigned school of attendance.  This selection is most useful for facility planning and for understanding the true impact of student population distribution in relation to school locations.

 ### Type 2) Create Plan Based on Enrollment 
A plan based upon resident and enrolled students displays statistics for both the current resident student population of each attendance area (same as the Current Resident Student plan) as well as the estimated enrollment totals at each school.  Changes in enrollment totals as attendance areas are modified are determined by a pre-defined set of rules based upon each studentsâ€™ program, grade and current school of enrollment. 

### Type 3) Create Plan Based on Forecasts
A redistricting plan based upon projected resident students displays the current and forecasted resident student population of each attendance area.  The statistics presented in this plan illustrate the true growth and decline of the student population within areas of the District and are useful for school opening and closure analysis as well as defining attendance areas that match forecasted resident population with school site capacities around the District. This is the proper method for long-term facility and attendance area planning
