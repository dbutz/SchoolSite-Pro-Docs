# Share your redistricting plan

SchoolSite Pro and Esri offer multiple ways to share your redistricting plan.

## ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise options: 
The best way to publish and share your redistricting plan online is by sharing it as a web map or as a web layer. Sharing your data as a web map means that your plan is uploaded online as a whole map, preserving things like layer symbology and including all layers within that map. Sharing your data as a web layer means that your plan is uploaded online as a single layer of data. A web map is composed of web layers. 

To do this, go to the first share ribbon. In the Share As section, select either Web Map or Web Layer. A dockpane will appear.

### Share as Web Map: 
- Name (a unique name of an item that doesn’t already exist on your ArcGIS Online content)
- Summary (a quick summary of the data you are uploading)
- Tags (tags help you quickly find the data in the future)
- Select your desired configuration
- Pick a folder location or create a new one in your ArcGIS online content.
- Choose who you will share this data with.
- After all the required information is filled out, click Analyze. You can proceed to Share if there are no errors and if only earnings exist. Errors will need to be fixed before sharing.
- Click Share.
